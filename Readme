Below are questions that are solved using python. main.py contains solution of Q1. Remaining are for other questions. 
Q1: You will be given a list of integers, arr, and a single integer k . You must create an array of length k from elements of arr such that its unfairness is minimized. Call that array arr’. Unfairness of an array is calculated as

max(arr’) - min(arr’)

Example:
arr = [1, 4, 7, 2]
k = 2

Pick any two elements, say  arr’ = [4,7]

Unfairness = max(4,7) - min(4,7) = 7 - 4 = 3

Testing for all pairs, the solution  provides the minimum unfairness.

Q2: You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification.
Note: Each input line ends with a "\n" character.

Input Format
The first line contains the integer, n. The next n lines each contain a word.

Output Format
Output n  lines. On the first line, output the number of distinct words from the input. On the second line, output the number of occurrences for each distinct word according to their appearance in the input.

Sample Input
4
bcdef
abcdefg
bcde
bcdef

Sample Output
3
2 1 1

Q3: For this challenge, you are given two complex numbers, and you have to print the result of their addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus operations. The real and imaginary precision part should be correct up to two decimal places.

Input Format
One line of input: The real and imaginary part of a number separated by a space.

Output Format
For two complex numbers  C and D, the output should be in the following sequence on separate lines: 
* C + D 
* C - D

Sample Input
2 1
5 6

Sample Output
7.00+7.00i
-3.00-5.00i
